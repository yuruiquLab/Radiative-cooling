The first row is the wavelength （μm）. The second row is the real part of the refractive index. The third row is the refractive index imaginary part.
The material parameters of SiO2 are derived from： https://refractiveindex.info/?shelf=main&book=SiO2&page=Popova.
The material parameters of Al2O3 are derived from： https://refractiveindex.info/?shelf=main&book=Al2O3&page=Querry-o
Less than 7 um wavelength, the imaginary part of the refractive index of SiO2 is very close to 0, so it is set to 0.
