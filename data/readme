The first row is the wavelength （μm）. The second row is the real part of the refractive index. The third row is the refractive index imaginary part.
The material parameters of SiO2 are derived from： https://refractiveindex.info/?shelf=main&book=SiO2&page=Popova. The imaginary part of the refractive index of silica is very close to 0 at wavelengths less than 7 micrometers and is therefore set to 0.
